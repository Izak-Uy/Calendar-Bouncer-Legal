This scope will be used to read and write to a users calendar in the event they get a meeting invite.

It will check if there are any available timeslots and then add it to their calendar.

More scopes may be needed in the future but for now only this is required

TLDR:
This is a university project for RMIT, if more information is required you can reach me via this email: s3948246@student.rmit.edu.au
